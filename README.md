# The company was an outgrowth of the Leg Laboratory, Raibert's research lab at MIT and Carnegie Mellon University. The Leg Laboratory helped establish the scientific basis for highly dynamic robots. These robots were inspired by the remarkable ability of animals to move with agility, dexterity, perception and intelligence, and the work there set the stage for the robots developed at Boston Dynamics.

# Their mission is to imagine and create exceptional robots that enrich peopleâ€™s lives, reducing the danger, repetition, and physically difficult aspects of work
