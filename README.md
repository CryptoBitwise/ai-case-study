# Boston Dynamics
# The company was founded in 1992
# Founded by Marc Raibert and Robert Playter
# The company was an outgrowth of the Leg Laboratory, Raibert's research lab at MIT and Carnegie Mellon University. The Leg Laboratory helped establish the scientific basis for highly dynamic robots. These robots were inspired by the remarkable ability of animals to move with agility, dexterity, perception and intelligence, and the work there set the stage for the robots developed at Boston Dynamics.
# Boston Dynamics is funded by share holders. Hyundai Motor Co. and Softbank Group(Japan company) both hold claim to the company as of 2022.
# Their mission is to imagine and create exceptional robots that enrich people’s lives, reducing the danger, repetition, and physically difficult aspects of work
# Boston Dynamics intended customer is mainly focused for commericial use. Examples would be warehouses or shipping companies that demand hard physical labor aspects.
# Boston Dynamics stands out in the robotics industry due to several unique offerings:
